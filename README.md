# Main Characters Only

Backend-focused learning project built to practice and demonstrate skills in server-side web development using **TypeScript**, **Express**, **EJS**, and **Passport.js**.

## Overview
A member-only web application where users can register, log in, post messages, and view message authors only when their access level permits it. The project focuses on authentication, authorization, and clean backend structure.

## Features
- **User Registration & Login**  
  Local authentication with Passport.js.

- **Role-Based Access Control**  
  Permissions determine which messages and authors a user can see.

- **Message System**  
  Authenticated members can create messages; visibility depends on access rules.

- **Server-Rendered Views**  
  EJS templates for all frontend pages.

## Tech Stack
- **Node.js + Express**
- **TypeScript**
- **EJS (Server-side rendering)**
- **Passport.js (Authentication)**
- **Database** (PostgreSQL)

## Project Goals
- Strengthen knowledge of authentication and session handling  
- Practice structuring real backend applications  
- Improve permission logic and secure data flow  
- Build a small but complete member-only system
